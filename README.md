#GIAIC Hackathon Milestones 1 to 5: 
#Interactive Resume Builder:

Welcome to our Hackathon project, where we aim to create an interactive resume builder that allows users to create their resumes dynamically or statically.

#Home Page:
The home page will feature a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to select between a dynamic resume and a static resume.

#Dynamic Resume:
Users will be able to input their information through a form, which will then be used to generate a dynamic resume.
The dynamic resume will be generated based on the user's input, and will feature interactive elements such as toggle buttons.

#Static Resume:
Users will be able to input their information through a form, which will then be used to generate a static resume.
The static resume will be a traditional, non-interactive resume that can be downloaded or printed.


#Features:
Interactive toggle buttons to customize the resume
Dynamic resume generation based on user input
Static resume generation for traditional resume needs
